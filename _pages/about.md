Julian is a musician, an amateur photographer, a booknerd, and an avid LEGO builder. Julian is currently a fellow at the NSO Youth Fellowship Program, a performance-oriented training program designed for serious music students. He has been the MTNA Maryland State Winner for the past two years, and he was the Eastern Division (comprising New England, Pennsylvania, and Maryland) Alternate in 2024. As the winner of the 2022 Kaufman Music Center International Competition and the 2023 AAMS Piano Competition, Julian has performed at venues such as the Kennedy Center and Merkin Hall. Julian is also a member of the Tacy Foundation, a non-profit organization dedicated to helping our elderly community through the power of music, where he regularly performs at senior assisted living centers. He spends his free time hiking, taking scenic photographs, and playing with LEGO--that is, if he isn't reading a book.
