Other than music, I love `reading, hiking, and painting`. I love visiting art museums; they not only provide inspiration for paintings but also help my musical interpretation. For example, looking at the original Nymphéas by Monet at the Musée de L'Orangerie was a huge inspiration when I started polishing [Ravel's Jeux d'eau](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnKFIp7CahY&pp=0gcJCdgAo7VqN5tD). I am also interested in `space travel and architecture`, which happen to be convenient interests to explain to my teachers why I doodled buildings (made of grand staves stacked on top of each other with windows that look like quarter rests) on the back sides of my exam sheets.
My favorite hobby by far, however, is `learning new languages` (this year, it was Latin). I believe that languages not only serve as means of communication but also as bridges to understanding different cultures. With the universal language of music, I look forward to working with many talented musicians in a chamber music setting and, together, learning how to connect the pieces of the giant puzzle that life truly is.
